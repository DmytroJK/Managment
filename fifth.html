<h1 align="center"> Video Card</h1>
<p>The video card is an expansion card that allows the computer to send graphical information to a video display device such as a monitor, TV, or projector.

Some other names for a video card include graphics card, graphics adapter, display adapter, video adapter, video controller, and add-in boards (AIBs).

A staggering number of companies manufacture video cards, but almost every one includes a graphics processing unit (GPU) from either NVIDIA Corporation or AMD.


Video Card Description
A video card is a piece of computer hardware that's rectangular in shape with numerous contacts on the bottom of the card and one or more ports on the side for connection to video displays and other devices.

The video card installs in an expansion slot on the motherboard. While most video cards are of the PCIe format, video cards come in other formats as well, including PCI and AGP. These additional formats are older standards and don't communicate with the CPU and other components as quickly as PCIe.

In a desktop, since the motherboard, case, and expansion cards are designed with compatibility in mind, the side of the video card fits just outside the back of the case when installed, making its ports (e.g. HDMI, DVI, or VGA) available for use.

Some video cards have only one port for connection to a standard monitor or projector while more advanced cards may have ports for connections to multiple output sources including additional monitors and televisions.

Still other cards may have inputs for video editing and other advanced tasks.

Laptops, tablets, and even smartphones, all have video cards, albeit smaller and most often non-replaceable.</p>
